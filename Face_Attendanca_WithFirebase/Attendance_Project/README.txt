How the Project Works:

1-) Open the UI.py file.

2-) Click on the Add/Remove Person button to add a person to the database.
3-) Log in with the credentials: Username: "asd" Password: "asd".
4-) Fill in the text labels.
5-) Click on the Add button, and the data is sent to the database. Then, the facial coordinates are obtained. For coordinates to be captured, the square around the person's face should be positioned slightly close to the center of the opened window on the screen.
6-) Click on the Take Picture button, and take a photo aligning your face with the camera.

7-) At the end of the day, encoding is required. However, the project needs to be closed and reopened for this. After all data is sent to the database, the project is reopened at the end of the day, and encoding is performed. This ensures all necessary database operations are completed.

8-) Click on the Open/Close Camera button to activate the facial recognition system.

(Note: Although individuals are recorded multiple times during the day, the encoding button is set to be executed when the project is closed and reopened at the end of the day to reflect these records on the next day.)

To run the project without the UI, execute the Run.py file.
